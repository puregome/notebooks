# PuReGoMe

[PuReGoMe](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/projects/puregome/) is a research project of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/intelligent-software-systems/intelligent-systems) and the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). We analyze Dutch social media messages to assess the opinion of the public towards the COVID-19 pandemic mesasures taken by the Dutch government.


## Data

PuReGome uses three data sources for social media analysis. Our main data source are Dutch tweets from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). We use Dutch posts from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and comments from [Nu.nl](https://www.nu.nl) as sources of verfication of the results obtained by the tweet analysis.

After a month has ended, the data from the month are collected. Here are the steps taken for each data source:


### Twitter:

1. the tweets are taken from the crawler of [twiqs.nl](http://twiqs.nl). They are stored in json format in hourly files. (this data set is not publically available)
2. the tweets are extracted from the json files and and stored in csv files (six columns: id\_str, in\_reply\_to\_status\_id\_str, user, verified, text, location). The conversion is performed by the script [query-text.py](https://github.com/puregome/queries/blob/master/query-text.py)
3. duplicate tweets are removed from from the csv files produced in step 2 by the script [text-unique.py](https://github.com/puregome/scripts/blob/master/text-unique.py)

(it would be useful to combine steps 2 and 3 in the future)


### Reddit

1. In a new month directory, run the script [get\_subreddit\_ids.py](https://github.com/puregome/scripts/blob/master/get_subreddit_py) to automatically retrieve the subreddits of the Dutch corona reddits
2. Manually expand the list of ids of the subreddit [Megathread Coronavirus COVID-19 in Nederland](https://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/search?q=Megathread+Coronavirus+COVID-19+in+Nederland&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)
3. Run the script [coronamessagesnl.py](https://github.com/puregome/scripts/blob/master/coronamessagesnl.py) to automatically retrieve the posts in the found subreddits
4. Run the notebook [reddit.ipynb](reddit.ipynb) to get all the posts from the monthly `downloads` directory and store them in the directory `text`


### Nu.nl

1. Run code blocks 1, 3 and 4 of the notebook [selenium-test.ipynb](selenium-test.ipynb), after updating the name of the file in URLFILE in code block 4
2. Restart the notebook and run code blocks 1 and 6, after updating the name of the file in URLFILE in code block 6 to the same value as under code block 4. This takes many hours to complete
3. The notebook can be copied and several copies can be run in parallel
4. When the notebooks have finished: delete all files of sizes 1 and 3 in this month's directory and rerun the notebooks
5. Repeat step 4 until no articles with comments are found
6. go to (cd) the directory data/nunl
7. run the script [../../scripts/combineNunlComments.sh](https://github.com/puregome/scripts/blob/master/combineNunlComments.sh) to update the files in the main directory `downloads`
8. run the notebook [nunl-convert-data.ipynb](nunl-convert-data.ipynb) to regenerate the data files in the directory `text`
